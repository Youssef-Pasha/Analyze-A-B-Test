# Docs: Use ab_testing to analyze results

## Project Details
This project was part of Udacity's Graduation Projects for Nanodegree in Data Analysis.

## Overview
For this project, I use concept of A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Dataset
The dataset is in the two attached files ab_data.csv, countries.csv.

## Technologies Used
Python Programming, Jupyter Notebook.

## Analysis Methods
Probability, Regression, ab_testing.

## conclusion
we cannot say that the new page is better than old page.
